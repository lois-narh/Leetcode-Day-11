# Zigzag Conversion

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the **Zigzag Conversion** algorithm, which rearranges characters of a given string into a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows and then reads the result row-by-row.

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `numRows`, the string is written in a zigzag pattern on `numRows` rows. The pattern starts from the top row, moves down to the bottom row, and then diagonally back up to the top, repeating this process. The output is the string read line by line from top to bottom.
